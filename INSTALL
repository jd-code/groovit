this a bare alpha version of groovit-INSTALL-HOWTO.

0 OPEN THE BOX
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Decompress the archive (alpha testers should know...) with something like
"tar -zxvf groovit-1.2.0.xx.tar.gz". You should NOT do this as root and also
you should not do this elsewhere than in a user home. When everything is
finished you should not erase the distribution directory since its an
alpha version and you're an alpha tester: I might ask you to try some
changes or to give me some piece of the result you have to be able to
improve groovit's quality.
With the future final version you should remove the dist' dir after
compilation and installation is finished.
You need to be root only for the final installation.

Also remember you can mail to the alpha-testers mailing list any of
your comments.

1 FAST WAY :
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the distribution directory you should type in "make".
This will automagically run the configure script for common installation,
run the compilation and linking and stops just before installation.
all this automatically.
Then it should ask you to become root to finish the installation.

1b ABOUT QUESTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When configuring, the script ask several questions. The default answer is
in most of the case the appropriate answer. I will explain every question
before the beta version comes out...

2 LESS FAST WAY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You think you need to change an unusual feature in groovit like the
DSP device to use (if you have more than one ?) or the number of
drum voices you want to handle.
Or may be the FAST-WAY didn't work.
Then type-in "make advanced" to enter the complete configuration script.
It will end before compilation, you'll have to type in the
"make dep ; make clean ; make" sequence to run the compilation.
At last you have to be root to install with make "install".

3 make options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is not a complete Manual for my Configure/Makefile combination,
only the main options :

   make config       runs the short configuration script (most values
                     defaulted) 
   make advanced     runs the long configuration script (offer the
                     ability to modify any options)
   make fast         build all with no question (useful for me, but for you ?)
   make dep          check dependencies 
   make tags         create tag file (for the author)
   make clean        brings you back before compilation (ie just after
                     configuration)
   make distclean    should bring you back to before any configuration
   make install      runs the installation script

4 WHERE'S THE MANUAL ?????
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After installation it is in you $prefix/man/man1 dir with prefix
having the value choosed during the installation script
(default is /usr/local/man/man1). It's a bare manual page that
points on the html version (more complete an friendly) that 
is located in $prefix/lib/groovit/rev#/doc/index.html
(default is file:///usr/local/lib/groovit/1.2.0.22/doc/index.html)
